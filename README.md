The sudoku coding project we have looked at, the code will be input a certain way. 
When the numbers are input into the code they will be put into a specific chosen spot on the board when it is ran. 
The sudoku board will of course not appear when you are coding, only until it is ran after coding and numbers are chosen to go in a certain space
